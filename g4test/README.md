# How to run NTST?

1. enter `NTST/`, add the `type` of steppers you want to run into the loop. For example, if we want to test `G4ClassicalRK4`, we put 4 in there. 

2. ` sh loglog.sh`, and then you will obtain the data in `data.txt`, open the file and you can directly copy the data into your excel. 

3. enter `TNTST/`, and set the `type` as exactly you put into `NTST/`, in our case, put 4, as for `TClassicalRK4`. 

4. repeat above step 2. in `TNTST/` and you will obtain the data for templated version.
